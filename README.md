# SPOT: A Smartphone-Based Platform to Tackle Heterogeneity
in Smart-Home Systems 
 The recent advancements of smart-home technologies, includ-
ing broad penetration of Internet-connected smart appliances
such as remotely controllable LED lights, thermostats, cam-
eras, motion sensors, and door locks, have changed the way we
interact with the appliances and perform our daily activities.
However, the significant heterogeneity in the emerging smart
appliances has led to isolated smart-home systems in which
each single appliance vendor provides proprietary solution for
appliance specific connectivity and user experience. In partic-
ular, the heterogeneity exists in different aspects of smart ap-
pliances such as control apps, communication protocol, mes-
saging schema, data structure and variable naming. To address
this challenge, we present SPOT, a user-centric, smartphone-
based platform for multi-vendor heterogeneous smart-home ap-
pliances. SPOT consists of several novel mechanisms includ-
ing XML and JAVA appliance driver models, annotation-based
API, an appliance-adaptive user interface and appliance/state
control. To validate the flexibility and generality of our ap-
proach, we have built a SPOT prototype based on 7 real ap-
pliances. Our extensive microbenchmark evaluation and case
studies show that SPOT tackles different types of heterogeneities
in smart appliances, significantly eases the development of cross-
device smart-home applications, and improves user experience
while incurring low runtime overhead.
